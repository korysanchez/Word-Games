I've bundled a few small word games I made

Coded purely in python utilizing the standard tkinter toolkit.

## Spelling Bee
The NYTimes spelling bee. I couldn't find their dictionary, so it uses a bit of random words.  
`python3 spelling_bee.py`

## Words per minute
Generates random words for you to type through, calculating your words per minute on the fly.  
`python3 wpm.py`

## Anagrams Solver
If you've ever played the iMessage game "Anagrams", this was just my way to win every time.  
`python3 anagrams_solver.py`
